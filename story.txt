Alice Emma has long flowing red hair.
Her Daddy says when the wind blows
throuugh her hair, it looks almost alive,
like a fiery bird in flight.
A beautifuk fiery bird, he tells her,
magical but untamed.
"Daddy, shush, there no such thing,"
she tells him, at the same time wanting
him to tell her more.
Shyly, she asks, "I mean, Daddy, is there?"
